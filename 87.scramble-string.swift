 * We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following
 * algorithm:
 *
 *
 * If the length of the string is 1, stop.
 * If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
 *
 * Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if
 * the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
 * RandomlyÂ decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same
 * order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
 * Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a
 * scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 * "great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
 * "gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings
 * and keep them in order.
 * "gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both
 * substrings. divide at ranom index each of them.
 * "g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first
 * substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 * "r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively,
 * divide "at" to "a/t".
 * "r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both
 * substrings in the same order.
 * The algorithm stops now and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
 * As there is one possible scenario that led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we
 * return true.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
 * Output: false
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
 * Output: true
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * s1.length == s2.length
 * 1 <= s1.length <= 30
 * s1 and s2 consist of lower-case English letters.
